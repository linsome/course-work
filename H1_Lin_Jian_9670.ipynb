        "1. Provide your solutions in new cells between the `Solution START` cell and the `Solution END` cell. Create as many new cells as necessary within these two blocks. Use code cells for your Python scripts and Markdown cells for explanatory text or answers to non-coding questions.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. You must __execute the code following every `Validation` block to get credits__ for the corresponding task. Failure to do so may result in a loss of points. (This, obviously, only applies to tasks with a `Validation` block.)\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Prioritize code readability. Just as in writing a book, the clarity of each line matters. Adopt the __one-statement-per-line__ rule. If you have a lengthy code statement, consider breaking it into multiple lines for clarity. Note you can use `'''` to start and end strings in Python that are written over multiple lines.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. To help understand and maintain code, you should add comments to explain your code. Use the hash symbol (#) to start writing a comment.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Submit your work by uploading it to __Gradescope__. Submission requires two files: the original Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) and its PDF export. To convert your Jupyter notebook file into a PDF, navigate to \"File\", select \"Download as\", and then choose either \"PDF via LaTeX\" or \"HTML\". If \"PDF via LaTeX\" does not work for you, export to \"HTML\", and then use Chrome to print the .html file into PDF.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. This assignment will be graded on your proficiency in programming. Be sure to demonstrate your abilities and submit your own, correct and readable solutions."
